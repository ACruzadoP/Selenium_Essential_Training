Selenium is great and comes with a couple of very useful tools:

    1. Selenium Grid. We already know what it's for, check the other course! 
        https://github.com/ACruzadoP/TRASH_Learning_Selenium
    2. Selenium IDE. At first it was only available in Firefox apparently. Now it can be installed in some other browsers and each
        one of them may be somehow different, so watch out!

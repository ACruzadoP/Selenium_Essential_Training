Here we are again!

These are the required tools for the course completion:
1. JDK (Java SE Development Kit)
    java -version
    output: NONE
2. IntelliJ (Java IDE)
    I wonder if I can use VS Code instead...
3. Chrome
4. ChromeDriver

Plus some additional toos:
1. Maven: a dependency management tool for Java
2. Selenium WebDriver language bindings for Java
3. JUnit as the assertion library


Considering that I don't know if I will be completing the excercises, I will not install JDK just yet.

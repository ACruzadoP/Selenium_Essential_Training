There are two types of waits to be used:

1. Implicit waits
    - Waits for a specified amount of time. The difference with the standalone SLEEP is that this one doesn't need the main method to have "throws InterruptedException".
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(#amount_of_time_to_wait_for#,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

2. Explicit waits
    - Waits for a specified amount of time for a certain condition to be true. If the condition is not met in the specified time, an exception is thrown.
        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,#max_amount_of_time_to_wait_for_in_seconds#) 
            it has to be accompanied by the statement to specify the element we are waiting to be displayed. 
            WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("element")));

        exercise: Ex_Files_Selenium_EssT\Exercise Files\05_03

        ExpectedConditions.
            elementToBeClickable()
            elementToBeSelected()
            presenceOfElementLocated()
            textToBePresentInElement()
            ....

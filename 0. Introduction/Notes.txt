Here we are again!

These are the required tools for the course completion:
1. JDK (Java SE Development Kit)
    java -version
    output: NONE
2. IntelliJ (Java IDE)
    I wonder if I could use VS Code instead...
3. Chrome
4. ChromeDriver

Plus some additional toos:
1. Maven: a dependency management tool for Java
2. Selenium WebDriver language bindings for Java
3. JUnit as the assertion library


Considering that I don't know if I will be completing the excercises, I will not install JDK just yet. But still, 
some notes will be taken bc, why not!?

I learnt something interesting while completing the course. Quitting the browser at the end of a test is a good way to determine if the test was a succeed,
    if something went wrong in the script, the browser will stay open and you will know that something went wrong...

Some of this were already written down from previous courses, but as a reminder let's go through each:
I cannot run them as I don't have JDK installed, but I will make sure everything is properly explained.

Example run with: https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/

1. Keyboard and mouse input

2. Autocomplete
    https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/autocomplete
    considerations: Autocomplete doesn't seem to work on my end... maybe I had to store some addresses in the browser before starting to automate

3. Scrolling

4. Switching to another window
    https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/switch-window
    exercise: Ex_Files_Selenium_EssT\Exercise Files\02_05
    2 ways of doing so, actually one as the other ones is for frames:
        a - driver.switchTo().window("windowName");
        b - driver.switchTo().frame("frameName");

5. Switching to an alert
    https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/switch-window
    exercise: Ex_Files_Selenium_EssT\Exercise Files\02_06
        driver.switchTo().alert();

6. JS commands through JavascriptExecutor
    https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/modal
    exercise: Ex_Files_Selenium_EssT\Exercise Files\02_07
    Uses:
        1. When WebDriver fails to click on any element 
        2. To trigger actions on page
        3. To perform movement on a page

7. Drag and Drop
